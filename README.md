## Data 

The first step was to access Telegram’s API. Telegram’s API grants access to my own usage data. I also requested chat id from a friend to get an access to both sides of chat data. I did it all in Python and used Jupyter Notebook as my kernel for this project. Before I started loading all the data, I downloaded all the required packages. You can find my full code and step by step instruction in my GitHub repository included at the end of this article.

My project includes chat data for 4 months. Data was downloaded in two batches. I processed 17,904 messages in total. These messages include strings, media content, gifs, stickers, and emojis.

## Goal of the Project 

Analyze topics of chat history on Telegram. Produce explanable topics and charts to understand the chat history.
